ABSTRACT = {Field oriented control (FOC), direct torque control (DTC) and finite set model predictive control (FS-MPC) are different strategies for high performance electrical drive systems. FOC uses linear controllers and pulse width modulation (PWM) to control the fundamental components of the load voltages. On the other hand, DTC and FS-MPC are nonlinear strategies that generate directly the voltage vectors in the absence of a modulator. This paper presents all three methods starting from theoretic operating principles, control structures and implementation. Experimental assessment is performed to discuss their advantages and limitations in detail. As main conclusions of this work, it is affirmed that different strategies have their own merits and all meet the requirements of modern high performance drives.},

    abstract = {This introduction to robotics offers a distinct and unified perspective of the mechanics, planning and control of robots. Ideal for self-learning, or for courses, as it assumes only freshman-level physics, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra and a little bit of computing background. Modern Robotics presents the state-of-the-art, screw-theoretic techniques capturing the most salient physical features of a robot in an intuitive geometrical way. With numerous exercises at the end of each chapter, accompanying software written to reinforce the concepts in the book and video lectures aimed at changing the classroom experience, this is the go-to textbook for learning about this fascinating subject.}

abstract = {The frequency response data of a system is used to design fixed-structure controllers for the $H2$ and $H\infty$ synthesis problem. The minimization of the two and infinity norm of the transfer function between the exogenous inputs and performance outputs is approximated by a convex optimization problem involving Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). A very general controller parametrization is used for continuous and discrete-time controllers with a matrix transfer function or state-space representation. Numerical results indicate that the proposed data-driven method gives equivalent performance to model-based approaches when a parametric model is available.}
